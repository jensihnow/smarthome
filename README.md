# SmartHome projects

This repository collects Smarthome / Automation projects I would like to share in public. While the Home is usually not getting smarter, the outcome is either automation or devices being connected to control them remotely.

I'm a huge fan of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), which in combination are really powerful. Please also see [Awesome Home Assistant](https://www.awesome-ha.com/) for many more ideas.

Have fun connecting and automating, in case of any issues - feel free to [open one](https://github.com/jensihnow/smarthome/issues/new).

## Projects

### 1. Smartdesk

This project is about connecting my height adjustable desk to Home Assistant, inspired by [flotomation](https://www.instagram.com/flotomation/).

### 2. Sensus HRI Water metering

This project I published on the Home Assistant Community page. Later on I might document all references here as well. Until then, please see the [community post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/water-metering-using-sensus-hri-libmbus-mqtt-and-utility-meter-integration).
